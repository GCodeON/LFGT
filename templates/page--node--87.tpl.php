                            <p>This pre-conference workshop provides first-time attendees with a foundation in behavior change, health communications, and social marketing. The Agents of Change Summit will build off of the principles discussed in this workshop.</p>

                            <p class="section-title">Workshop Description:</p>
                            <p>This workshop will provide an overview of how health communications and social marketing can contribute to health behavior change by exploring the behavior change pathways of knowledge, ability, exchange, and norms. Following the overview, the session will explore case studies showcasing how each pathway has been successfully implemented within a specific community and through a specific program. Evaluation best practices will be shared and tips for setting up a program for success from the time a challenge is identified and a strategic pathway is selected, through campaign development, implementation and evaluation.</p>
                            <p>Finally, participants will engage in interactive exercises that allow them to apply the Behavior Change Pathways Framework and evaluation principles to their local communities. Challenges and tips for identifying the strategy that will drive the most impact with the most efficient use of often scarce funds will be explored through peer-to-peer discussions and case studies.</p>

                            <p class="section-title">Workshop Outcomes:</p>
                            <p>By the end of this workshop, participants will have a strong foundation of behavior change science to guide their programs at home. Workshop participants will leave with an outline and action plan that is tailored to their specific area of focus. As the content for the rest of the Agents of Change Summit will build on this foundation, workshop participants will be well positioned to get the most out of all keynote, abstract, and panel sessions.</p>

                            <p>This session is designed for professionals involved in planning and/or implementing digital and social media strategies within behavior change marketing programs. It will be especially useful for communicators who are challenged to positively impact health outcomes despite contracting budgets, unique populations, and strict evaluation requirements.</p>

                            <p class="section-title">Workshop Description:</p>
                            <p>The media landscape has changed dramatically in the last ten, five and even two years. Traditional media channels like television, print and OOH provide broad awareness but are difficult to measure without long-term evaluation studies. Digital media is more sophisticated and measurable than ever but is also constantly changing making it difficult for campaign managers to keep up with latest developments, let alone establish a clear understanding of how best to use digital media to contribute to specific campaign outcomes.</p>
                            <p>This workshop is designed to demystify digital and social media by providing an overview of the media landscape, measurement tools, and budgeting best practices. It will showcase specific case studies in health communications, policy, and prevention to show how seemingly small budgets can have a big impact on focused target audiences and can outperform traditional media channels. Finally, it will provide a framework to compare the reach, frequency and cost per impression metrics of traditional media versus digital media so that campaign planners can feel more confident investing in new digital opportunities.</p>

                            <p class="section-title">Workshop Outcomes:</p>
                            <p>Workshop participants will leave with an understanding of both the current traditional and digital media landscapes and a specific checklist of how to develop a digital and social media plan designed to meet specific campaign objectives. As the content for the rest of the Agents of Change Summit will build on this foundation, workshop participants will be well positioned to get the most out of all keynote, abstract, and panel sessions.</p>
